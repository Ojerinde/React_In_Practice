# Site Instruction

I built the site to put into practice some React concepts that I had recently learned.

The following is all you need to know to use the site

* Your first name should longer than 3 character.
* Your last name should be longer than 5 character.
* Your email should have @ symbol.
* Once the three inputs field are valid, the button will be enabled and you can submit.
* On submission, A succes modal will appear which you can close by clicking the modal or on the close button.
* The submitted details will be displayed on the card beside it. If you submit more than one time, you can view the next details by clicking on `next` and `prev` to go back.
* The displayed image is also hard-coded.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
